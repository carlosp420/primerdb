Some ideas, anything else come to mind?

Primer table

id -> number
gene_code -> eg COI
primer_name -> primer name (eg LCO)
primer_seq ->
primer_seq_size -> eg 20 bp
annealing_temp ->
forward_or_reverse -> F or R 
date_creation ->
date_modification ->
timestamp ->
notes ->

Amplicon table

id? -> number
gene_code -> eg COI
amplicon_name -> eg COI-begin, could also be id?
forward_primer -> eg LCO
reverse_primer -> eg HCO
amplicon_size ->
amplified -> yes/no/not yet tested 
pcr_program -> eg 40CYC50
amplified -> yes/no
notes -> details about what was tried
date_creation ->
date_modification ->
timestamp ->
